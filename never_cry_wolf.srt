1
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:37,695
<i>(man) I just jumped at
the opportunity to go,</i>

2
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,130
<i>without even thinking about it, really,</i>

3
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,604
<i>because it opened the way to an old
and very naive childhood fantasy of mine.</i>

4
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,697
<i>To go off into the wilderness</i>

5
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:52,336
<i>and test myself against
all the dangerous things lurking there.</i>

6
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:57,941
<i>And to find that basic animal I secretly
hoped was hidden somewhere in myself.</i>

7
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:02,044
<i>I imagined that at that point
I'd become a new man,</i>

8
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:06,650
<i>with a strength and courage
that I'd never known before.</i>

9
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,894
<i>As I traveled north,
it was on about the third day</i>

10
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:16,595
<i>that the reality of what I was about to try
to do began to seep into my bones</i>

11
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:20,332
<i>and gather in a knot
in the pit of my stomach.</i>

12
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:30,179
<i>Then I finally reached
the end of the line, Nootsack.</i>

13
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:34,950
<i>The sheer bulk of the supplies
the department sent along set me back,</i>

14
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,216
<i>as I had to get not only myself
but all this stuff</i>

15
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,157
<i>another 300 miles into the wilderness.</i>

16
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,297
So, you think north of here?

17
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,100
<i>The place is crawling with 'em,</i>

18
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:56,867
<i>But you wouldn't wanna go up there, son,</i>

19
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,870
<i>Got nothing to eat up there now,</i>

20
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:04,883
<i>There's nothing but ice
and snow and trees and,,,</i>

21
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:10,047
<i>You would be
the only fresh meat around there,</i>

22
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:14,549
<i>They'll come after you, son,</i>

23
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:19,061
<i>Just for the ugly fun of tearing you apart,</i>

24
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,831
<i>I'd heard some of the tales
about the Arctic,</i>

25
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:34,005
<i>The mad trappers, Diamond Tooth Gertie,
the ice-worm cocktail and all that,</i>

26
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,174
<i>so I was prepared
for things to be a little weird.</i>

27
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,718
<i>You found the bayonets,
I knew you would,</i>

28
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,777
<i>- Charlie,
- (# bassoon playing)</i>

29
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:47,184
<i>That's much better, much better, Francis,
Keep practicing,</i>

30
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:51,527
<i>The only plane in Nootsack
belonged to a part-time bush pilot,</i>

31
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,625
<i>gambler and real-estate tycoon
named Rosie Little.</i>

32
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:59,468
<i>While negotiating our deal, he introduced
me to this drink that he'd invented.</i>

33
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,769
<i>Known locally as Moose Juice,</i>

34
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:06,210
<i>it consisted of equal parts
Moose Brand beer and ethyl alcohol.</i>

35
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:09,510
<i>Before I knew it,
my old fear of flying evaporated,</i>

36
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:14,952
<i>and I spent all the money I had left
on 24 cases of beer.</i>

37
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,630
<i>T oo much weight, Tyler,</i>

38
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,499
Hang on!

39
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:33,096
<i>Whoa,,, Nelly!</i>

40
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:45,608
<i>Come on, Something else out of there now,
The big, heavy ones, Tyler,</i>

41
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:51,890
<i>I really had no way of knowing
exactly what of the department's gear</i>

42
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,949
<i>we donated to the people of Nootsack.</i>

43
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,485
<i>That big wooden box there,
Get rid of it, Go on, You don't need that,</i>

44
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:01,863
<i>But by our third attempt at takeoff,
it was a lot of what I might really need.</i>

45
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:07,429
<i>I tried not to think about it.
In fact, I tried not to think at all.</i>

46
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:21,142
<i>This one is it, I can feel it,</i>

47
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:58,147
<i>With my eyes still shut,
I realized that I was still alive.</i>

48
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,954
<i>But this was only the beginning.</i>

49
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:31,279
<i>It's funny how I keep thinking back
to that going-away party.</i>

50
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:35,309
<i>All the toasts by Dr Spivey
and Dr Showwalter,</i>

51
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:39,449
<i>and everybody singing
old Johnny Horton songs.</i>

52
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:45,794
<i>And the cake with all the coconut frosting,
with the plastic snowshoes on top.</i>

53
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,972
<i>But, then, why me?</i>

54
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,136
<i>Maybe this whole thing was a mistake.</i>

55
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:10,215
<i>Maybe my name just somehow
got onto the wrong page.</i>

56
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:14,282
<i>It might have been a typo, or maybe
somebody spilled a cup of coffee,</i>

57
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,818
<i>shuffled a couple of pages,
and there I was.</i>

58
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:27,128
<i>I can 't go on with this. This is suicide.</i>

59
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:34,707
<i>But I can 't turn around now.
I'd be a laughing stock.</i>

60
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:41,711
<i>Still, I wouldn 't last six hours down there,
let alone six months.</i>

61
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,448
<i>Uh ,,,</i>

62
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,626
<i>How do you,,,?</i>

63
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,388
<i>Don't worry about a thing,</i>

64
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:59,063
<i>I feel my way through these mountains
blindfolded all the time,</i>

65
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,551
<i>Tell me, Tyler,,,</i>

66
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:21,492
what's in the Valley of the Blackstone?

67
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,189
What is it? Manganese?

68
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,824
<i>Can't be oil,</i>

69
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:31,126
Is it gold?

70
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:34,195
<i>It's kind of hard to say,</i>

71
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:40,742
<i>You're a smart man, Tyler,
Keep your own counsel,</i>

72
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:44,715
We're all of us prospectors
up here, eh, Tyler?

73
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:51,450
Scratching for that one crack in the ground

74
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:54,789
<i>so we'll never have to scratch again,</i>

75
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:59,354
<i>I'll let you in on a little secret, Tyler,</i>

76
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,923
<i>The gold's not in the ground,</i>

77
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:05,936
<i>The gold's not anywhere up here,</i>

78
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,769
<i>The real gold is south of 60,</i>

79
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:15,076
<i>Sittin' in living rooms,
stuck facing the boob tube, bored to death,</i>

80
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:17,672
Bored to death, Tyler!

81
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,742
<i>(clunking)</i>

82
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,112
Ah.

83
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,624
<i>(engine splutters)</i>

84
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,929
<i>- (screeching)
- What was that?</i>

85
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:37,859
<i>(rapid bleeping)</i>

86
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,496
Oh, Lord!

87
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,139
Darn!

88
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,644
<i>- What's wrong?
- Take the stick,</i>

89
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,753
Arrrrgh!

90
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:04,019
What's wrong?

91
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:11,301
<i>Boredom, Tyler,</i>

92
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,838
<i>Boredom, that's what's wrong,</i>

93
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:16,898
And how do you beat boredom, Tyler?

94
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,301
Adventure.

95
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,707
Adventure, Tyler.

96
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:27,545
Where are you going? Rosie!

97
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:31,779
<i>Rosie, what are you doing?
I can't fly this thing, What do I do?</i>

98
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,985
<i>Catch the updraft there, Tyler, That's it,</i>

99
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,393
<i>Right in the middle, Good,</i>

100
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,062
<i>- Oh!
- Ah!</i>

101
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,106
Tyler, easy, easy, easy!

102
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:54,010
<i>- Back the other way! Turn it the other way!
- What?</i>

103
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,878
<i>Tyler, back, Tyler! Tyler!</i>

104
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,509
Easy! Tyler!

105
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,917
<i>The other way, That's it,</i>

106
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,149
<i>That's it, Good, Tyler,</i>

107
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,022
<i>That's it, You learn fast,</i>

108
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,556
<i>(engine starts)</i>

109
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:32,974
<i>(Rosie) Whoo!</i>

110
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:24,529
<i>Rosie, it's freezing,</i>

111
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:27,766
<i>Keep moving, Tyler, Gotta keep moving,</i>

112
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,771
<i>(smashing)</i>

113

<i>- You'll be fine,
- Gotta take it easy with some of this stuff,</i>

114
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,640
<i>Oh, uh,,,</i>

115
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:41,242
Mind your toes!

116
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:45,490
<i>Speed, Speed is of the essence, Tyler,</i>

117
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,526
<i>Especially when you don't know
how much fuel you got,</i>

<i>(smashing)</i>

119
00:13:55,835 --> 00:14:00,636
<i>You got any last messages for the world,
Tyler, you better let me have 'em now,</i>

120
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:10,305
<i>That's sneaky, Tyler, Very sneaky,</i>

121
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,715
<i>Wait, Rosie! Rosie!</i>

122
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,118
<i>- Rosie,
- What?</i>

123
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,332
Hey?

124
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,198
Remember my position, will you?

125
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,831
<i>Sure, I'll stop by
for a drink sometime, huh?</i>

126
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,780
Rosie! Rosie!

127
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:47,217
What?

128
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:51,916
<i>- What is my position?
- It beats the hell out of me, Tyler,</i>

129
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:55,358
<i>I just hope I can find my way home,</i>

130
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,691
<i>Good luck, Tyler,</i>

131
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:59,390
<i>Yeah,</i>

132
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,686
<i>Well, interesting.</i>

133
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:43,262
<i>Now, what are the possibilities here?</i>

134

<i>The possibilities...</i>

<i>are many.</i>

136

<i>Gotta stay rational, be objective and. . .</i>

137
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:11,322
<i>plan out all the proper procedures
before doing anything else.</i>

138
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:17,825
<i>Make a list of priorities, remembering,
of course, to take into account variables,</i>

<i>It's perplexing.</i>

280
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:05,883
<i>The overall reason behind the study

<i>that wolves are responsible
for the disastrous decline in caribou.</i>

<i>and the local environment

<i>Yet the wolves seem perfectly healthy.</i>

<i>The whole question of sustenance

00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:22,500
<i>(chuckles)</i>

<i>(growls)</i>

<i>(squealing)</i>

00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:28,534
<i>(snarling)</i>

313
00:53:30,274 --> 00:53:33,607
<i>Five wolves appeared today.</i>

314
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:37,841
<i>I expected one of the pack battles
I'd read so much about.</i>

315
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:40,246
<i>It was Angie who was
right in the middle of things,</i>

316
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:43,809
<i>asserting her position
as the dominant female.</i>

317
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,481
<i>The challenges and assertions
were mostly symbolic.</i>

318
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,547
<i>There was no real fighting.</i>

319
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:51,389
<i>But Angeline got her point across.</i>

320
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:54,026
<i>George was never challenged.</i>

321
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:56,793
<i>He just stood there
with his air of masterful certainty,</i>

322
00:53:56,867 --> 00:53:59,495
<i>the alpha wolf of the pack.</i>

323
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:02,367
<i>Usually, only the dominant pair
mate and have offspring,</i>

324
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:05,499
<i>going to seek their own privacy
for that purpose.</i>

325
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:09,807
<i>Apparently, the time had arrived
to rejoin the pack.</i>

326
00:54:38,175 --> 00:54:42,509
<i>There's a young brown wolf who seems
to be a particular favorite of the cubs.</i>

327
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:45,173
<i>I've named him Uncle Albert.</i>

328
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:54,817
<i>Now Angeline is free again
to join George on his nightly rounds.</i>

329
00:55:26,189 --> 00:55:28,180
<i>July 1 2.</i>

330
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:35,062
<i>I wonder why it was that long ago
I became a watcher of things.</i>

331
00:55:35,132 --> 00:55:39,933
<i>Always watching others do and feel things
I wouldn't or couldn't do myself.</i>

332
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:46,972
<i>Always standing off at a distance,
isolated, detached.</i>

333
00:55:48,879 --> 00:55:52,645
<i>I envy the wolves
for how they experience the world.</i>

334
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:55,310
<i>Always in such direct contact
with their environment,</i>

335
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:57,376
<i>traveling through their territories,</i>

336
00:55:57,454 --> 00:56:02,050
<i>alert and attuned to all the signs
coming in through their senses,</i>

337
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:06,357
<i>telling them where a rabbit
recently passed or the sweet water lay,</i>

338
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:10,958
<i>revealing a whole universe to them
that we can never really know.</i>

339
00:56:15,005 --> 00:56:20,705
<i>But I sit behind glass lenses,
filling up notebooks and triplicate forms,</i>

340
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:26,079
<i>trying to capture the wolves
within the pages of my journal.</i>

341
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:29,744
<i>And what'll be done with the study
when I'm finished?</i>

342
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:33,620
<i>Once these wolves
have been exposed to my world. . .</i>

343
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:37,190
<i>what will happen to them ?</i>

344
00:56:56,546 --> 00:57:00,573
<i>There's a strange wolf
that I only see fleetingly.</i>

345
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:06,248
<i>He must be part of the pack,
but an outsider,</i>

346
00:57:06,323 --> 00:57:08,985
<i>always following at a distance.</i>

347
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:13,089
<i>Perhaps another watcher.</i>

348
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:28,230
<i>(high-pitched bird call)</i>

349
00:58:28,305 --> 00:58:30,296
Oh!

350
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:03,706
<i>Ootek thought you might need
some company,</i>

351
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,633
Ootek?

352
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:13,005
<i>Hello,</i>

353
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:30,427
<i>Really can't tell you how glad I am
to see the two of you,</i>

354
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:34,163
<i>It's been so long
since I heard another human voice,</i>

355
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:37,103
You have any ketchup here?

356
00:59:37,841 --> 00:59:41,777
<i>No, I don't, I'm sorry,
I ran out a couple of weeks ago,</i>

357
00:59:41,845 --> 00:59:44,336
<i>Here, have some fish,</i>

358
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:48,548
<i>Uh, no,</i>

359
00:59:48,618 --> 00:59:51,109
<i>No, thanks, I don't eat fish,</i>

360
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:56,255
What do you eat?

361
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:58,717
<i>Actually,,,</i>

362
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:02,057
<i>I eat mice,</i>

363
01:00:04,234 --> 01:00:07,533
<i>- You eat mice?
- Yeah,</i>

364
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:14,499
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

365
01:00:16,913 --> 01:00:19,711
<i>It's an experiment, really,</i>

366
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:23,549
<i>You see, the wolves are supposed to eat
caribou, However, there are no caribou,</i>

367
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,145
<i>Basically, what the wolves
have been eating is mice,</i>

368
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:30,921
So I'm conducting an experiment
to see whether a carnivore, a big animal,

369
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:33,053
<i>can live on nothing but mice,</i>

370
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:37,566
<i>So I've been just eating mice,
and I'm doing fine,</i>

371
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:43,328
<i>(translates)</i>

372
01:01:01,558 --> 01:01:05,722
<i>- What does he say?
- He says, "Good idea,"</i>

373
01:01:09,933 --> 01:01:12,595
<i>(two men speak native language)</i>

374
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:18,634
<i>(Tyler) Syringe,</i>

375
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:20,699
<i>There,</i>

376
01:01:28,384 --> 01:01:32,844
<i>- What's that?
- Clamp, This thing? Yeah,</i>

377
01:01:32,922 --> 01:01:34,981
See the way this is set up here?

378
01:01:35,058 --> 01:01:38,653
<i>This is so it grabs ahold, You got him,</i>

379
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:40,719
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

380
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:44,128
<i>It's a gripper,</i>

381
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,430
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

382
01:01:46,503 --> 01:01:49,097
<i>I know what that is,
They had them at the mines,</i>

383
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:53,700
<i>Yeah, that's right, It's a gas mask,
except that I use it for wolf scats,</i>

384
01:01:53,777 --> 01:01:59,181
<i>The wolf scat has little tiny animals,
little tiny parasites,</i>

385
01:01:59,249 --> 01:02:02,776
And if you breathe these things in,
you breathe these little guys,

386
01:02:02,852 --> 01:02:07,448
<i>they go up into your brain
and they eat it out,</i>

387
01:02:07,524 --> 01:02:09,890
Scat? What is scat?

388
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:11,918
<i>Uh,,,</i>

389
01:02:11,995 --> 01:02:14,054
<i>Wolf droppings,</i>

390
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:18,328
See, the idea behind this is
if you study what comes out of a wolf,

391
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:21,768
<i>you get a pretty good idea what went in,</i>

392
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:23,669
<i>Hmm,</i>

393
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:27,801
<i>I got a whole bag of them down there,
I got a whole sack,</i>

394
01:02:27,877 --> 01:02:29,868
<i>(translates)</i>

<i>(speaks native language)</i>

396
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,951
What did he say?

397
01:02:46,029 --> 01:02:48,759
<i>He says, "Good idea,"</i>

398
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:10,976
<i>(howling)</i>

<i>(howling continues)</i>

01:03:28,705 --> 01:03:31,037
<i>(speak native language)</i>

401
01:03:42,785 --> 01:03:46,653
<i>And so they settled in with me,
as if nothing could be more natural.</i>

402
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:54,463
<i>For my part,
I'm glad to have the company.</i>

403
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:56,521
<i>A seven,</i>

404
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:02,427
<i>Mike had gone to school in the south.</i>

405
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:04,905
<i>When his parents died,
Ootek adopted him.</i>

406
01:04:04,974 --> 01:04:08,933
<i>Traditionally, they are no orphans
among the Inuit.</i>

407
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:11,503
<i>(plays stilted tune)</i>

408
01:04:22,659 --> 01:04:25,856
I met a girl in a bar,

409
01:04:25,929 --> 01:04:29,057
<i>and she wanted me to buy her drinks,
so I bought her some,</i>

410
01:04:29,132 --> 01:04:33,466
<i>And then after a while,
she wanted to come home with me,</i>

411
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:37,632
<i>But I made a mistake,</i>

412
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:40,369
<i>I smiled at her,</i>

413
01:04:41,144 --> 01:04:45,740
<i>That's what happens when a meat eater
becomes a sugar eater,</i>

414
01:05:00,263 --> 01:05:03,460
<i>Ootek has taken
a particular interest in the study,</i>

415
01:05:03,533 --> 01:05:09,961
<i>though I've learned there is little about
wolves that he doesn 't already know.</i>

416
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:19,243
<i>But I sense there is another side to Ootek,</i>

417
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:22,250
<i>some part of his nature
that he hasn 't shown.</i>

418
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:24,479
<i>I try not to annoy him
with too many questions,</i>

419
01:05:24,554 --> 01:05:27,921
<i>but there are many things I'd like to know.</i>

420
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:56,449
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

421
01:06:01,924 --> 01:06:05,690
<i>When he was young
he used to follow the wolves on their hunts,</i>

422
01:06:07,096 --> 01:06:09,428
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

423
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:16,065
<i>The wolf is his helping spirit: amarok.</i>

424
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:21,741
<i>- Ama...
- Amarok.</i>

425
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,802
<i>- Ama...
- The wolf,</i>

<i>(speaks native language)</i>

427
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:42,495
<i>He went 30 days without food
and without protection from the cold,</i>

428
01:06:49,705 --> 01:06:52,196
<i>Then he saw the wolf,</i>

429
01:06:59,749 --> 01:07:03,742
<i>He felt the wolf bite into his heart,</i>

430
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:15,127
<i>When he woke up, he was all in one piece,</i>

431
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:21,436
<i>That's how the wolf
became his helping spirit,</i>

432
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:35,841
<i>(howling)</i>

433
01:08:25,635 --> 01:08:28,866
<i>I wonder what makes them howl like that,</i>

434
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:34,332
<i>They howl when they're lonely,</i>

435
01:08:36,812 --> 01:08:39,303
<i>Or to call their friends,</i>

436
01:08:41,384 --> 01:08:45,878
<i>That way, the other,,,
the others will know where they are,</i>

437
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:49,891
<i>and then sooner or later
they're bound to meet up,</i>

438
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:57,259
<i>That's the way to catch wolves,
Go where they're howling,</i>

439
01:08:57,333 --> 01:09:00,302
Hide behind a rock,

440
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:02,735
<i>and then howl like one of them,</i>

441
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:07,242
<i>And then,,, they will come to investigate,</i>

442
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:12,244
Yeah?

443
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:18,183
<i>When they get close enough,
you shoot 'em,</i>

444
01:09:20,423 --> 01:09:23,517
<i>You shoot 'em,
Hopefully you hit 'em,</i>

445
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:32,394
<i>That's how you kill a wolf,</i>

446
01:09:39,442 --> 01:09:42,673
<i>To me, wolves mean money,</i>

447
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:47,408
<i>It's a way of making a living,</i>

448

<i>These ones? Oh,</i>

<i>No, I don't think so,</i>

01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:34,488
<i>Besides, you would get mad
if I killed one of them,</i>

458
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:37,555
<i>And your gun is bigger than mine,</i>

459
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:45,136
<i>Yeah,</i>

460
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:48,900
<i>I'd like to, though,</i>

461
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:12,693
<i>Last week in August.</i>

462
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:16,568
<i>The Arctic summer has almost ended.</i>

463
01:11:16,639 --> 01:11:22,874
<i>As the time grows short, I'm reluctant to
even sleep, for fear of missing something.</i>

464
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:26,904
<i>It's hard to imagine
that soon I'll have to leave.</i>

465
01:11:26,982 --> 01:11:30,645
<i>But this place doesn 't belong to man.
It belongs to the wolves.</i>

466
01:11:33,089 --> 01:11:37,321
<i>I can't really be sad, because it's here
that I've begun to feel wonder again,</i>

467
01:11:37,393 --> 01:11:41,853
<i>like when I was a kid,
and this makes me deeply happy.</i>

468
01:11:42,865 --> 01:11:48,963
<i>I wish I could say thank so,
just so, straight into the universe.</i>

469
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:17,824
<i>The rest of Ootek's family,
traveling through on their way north,</i>

470
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:20,391
<i>stopped by to spend the night.</i>

471
01:12:33,649 --> 01:12:36,140
<i>(Ootek speaks native language)</i>

472
01:12:40,823 --> 01:12:44,987
He wants me to tell you a story
of when there was nothing in the world

473
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:48,518
<i>except for a man and a woman,</i>

474
01:12:48,597 --> 01:12:51,259
The woman came to a hole in the ice,

475
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:57,272
<i>and she reached in and felt something,
so she pulled it out,</i>

476
01:12:58,073 --> 01:13:01,042
<i>And itwasatuktu,which isthecaribou.</i>

477
01:13:02,011 --> 01:13:07,472
<i>And it was this animal that the lnuit
needed for their food and clothing,</i>

478
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:14,854
<i>For many years there were so many
caribou that the people called them lice,</i>

479
01:13:14,924 --> 01:13:19,623
But soon all the hunting killed off
all the fat, healthy animals,

480
01:13:19,695 --> 01:13:24,723
<i>and the only ones left over
were the weak, sick ones,</i>

481
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,759
Soon they began to breed and multiply,

482
01:13:30,039 --> 01:13:33,031
<i>and the herd got weak,</i>

483
01:13:35,377 --> 01:13:37,174
<i>Sick,</i>

484
01:13:42,017 --> 01:13:44,485
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

485
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:54,487
<i>So the people came back to the woman
to ask her what to do,</i>

486
01:13:54,563 --> 01:13:57,464
She went back to the hole in the ice,

487
01:13:57,533 --> 01:14:02,300
because she needed a tool
to cut the sickness out of the herd,

488
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:05,135
<i>and the amarok was born,</i>

489
01:14:07,343 --> 01:14:09,334
<i>Amarok.</i>

490
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:16,608
The wolves hunted the caribou
and they killed off all the weak, sick ones,

491
01:14:17,353 --> 01:14:21,551
<i>and the people had
all the caribou that they needed,</i>

492
01:14:21,624 --> 01:14:23,956
<i>(speak native language)</i>

493
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:41,235
<i>She says maybe you're like Ootek,</i>

494
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:44,802
<i>Maybe a long time ago
the wolf devoured you,</i>

495
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:52,317
<i>(distant howl)</i>

496
01:14:55,357 --> 01:14:57,348
<i>(howling)</i>

497
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:10,828
<i>(howling continues)</i>

498
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:15,574
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

499
01:15:20,783 --> 01:15:23,183
He knows, doesn't he?

500
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:27,087
<i>He knows what they're saying,</i>

501
01:15:27,156 --> 01:15:32,093
The caribou are coming south
and the hunting will be good,

502
01:15:32,161 --> 01:15:34,959
<i>and the amarok will be there,</i>

503
01:16:19,475 --> 01:16:22,103
<i>We broke camp
and went in separate directions.</i>

504
01:16:22,177 --> 01:16:25,840
<i>Mike went south, while Ootek
led me on a three-day trek,</i>

505
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:29,247
<i>down out of the high country
and on to the tundra.</i>

506
01:16:29,318 --> 01:16:32,549
<i>There will be wolves there,
he said, as well as the ''tuktu'',</i>

507
01:16:32,621 --> 01:16:37,456
<i>the great caribou herds
that once had sustained his people.</i>

508
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:27,033
<i>His endurance
is very much greater than mine,</i>

509
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:29,600
<i>but there are no expectations of me.</i>

510
01:17:29,678 --> 01:17:33,409
<i>Not, I think, because I am the ''kabloona, ''
the white man,</i>

511
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:37,612
<i>but because he doesn 't recognize
such a thing as impatience.</i>

512
01:17:37,686 --> 01:17:40,154
<i>(thunder)</i>

<i>(caribou grunting)</i>

516
01:25:42,704 --> 01:25:47,300
<i>Deep in the bone,
the marrow reveals the disease.</i>

517
01:25:47,375 --> 01:25:51,744
<i>And she had found the tool
to cut the sickness from the herd.</i>

518
01:26:03,491 --> 01:26:05,482
<i>(chanting)</i>

Come on, right over here!

524
01:27:45,293 --> 01:27:47,022
<i>Hello, Rosie,</i>

525
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:51,292
Is that you, Tyler?

526
01:27:53,168 --> 01:27:56,035
<i>They called off the search,
They wrote you off,</i>

527
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:59,505
<i>I even said a few Hail Marys for you myself,</i>

528
01:27:59,574 --> 01:28:03,169
<i>But I never believed in ghosts,
How are you?</i>

529
01:28:03,244 --> 01:28:08,409
<i>- You all right? You got all your pieces?
- I'm all right, yeah,</i>

530
01:28:08,483 --> 01:28:11,475
<i>- You've changed,
- I've changed?</i>

531
01:28:14,923 --> 01:28:19,155
What the hell you been
doing out here, anyway?

532
01:28:19,227 --> 01:28:23,926
<i>Tyler, you wouldn't believe what's
happened, It's fantastic, I hit the jackpot,</i>

533
01:28:23,998 --> 01:28:26,125
<i>Two new planes, a new hotel,</i>

534
01:28:26,201 --> 01:28:28,601
Have you seen an old lnuk?

535
01:28:28,670 --> 01:28:32,800
Inuk? Eskimo? Drunk or sober?

536
01:28:32,874 --> 01:28:34,705
<i>Quite sober,</i>

537
01:28:37,512 --> 01:28:39,844
<i>Join the party,</i>

538
01:28:47,822 --> 01:28:51,087
Altogether, 1400acres.

539
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:55,619
<i>Top of the mountain down to the lake,
including mineral rights,</i>

540
01:28:55,697 --> 01:29:00,964
<i>But the real ace in the hole for us right now
is the hot spring right up there,</i>

541
01:29:01,035 --> 01:29:04,596
<i>Amazing, lncredible, Steaming hot water
coming right out of the ground,</i>

542
01:29:04,672 --> 01:29:07,971
When I say hot water,
what are you thinking?

543
01:29:08,042 --> 01:29:10,374
Sitting in the bath tub?

544
01:29:11,579 --> 01:29:16,573
<i>Japanese, A little bit of advertising,
plenty of raw fish,</i>

545
01:29:18,553 --> 01:29:21,613
<i>Beautiful country all right,</i>

546
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:24,180
<i>Limitless possibilities,</i>

547
01:29:25,226 --> 01:29:28,787
<i>Japanese, That's a great angle, Rosie,</i>

548
01:29:30,465 --> 01:29:33,434
<i>Wait, You haven't heard the best part,
Listen to this,</i>

549
01:29:33,501 --> 01:29:38,837
Once they've soaked their little buns
in our magic, medicinal hot spring,

550
01:29:38,907 --> 01:29:42,240
<i>you bottle it up, stick a fancy label on it,
they take it home with them,</i>

551
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:45,006
<i>Before you know it, we'll be
shipping it outta here by the truckload,</i>

552
01:29:45,079 --> 01:29:50,244
<i>And what does it cost us? Nothing,
Just bubbles right out of the ground,</i>

553
01:29:50,318 --> 01:29:53,048
<i>I bet you we could figure out a way
to bottle the air up here, too,</i>

554
01:29:53,121 --> 01:29:55,555
<i>Fantastic,</i>

555

<i>Gentlemen, here's to the future,</i>

<i>Come on, Tyler, Climb in,</i>

558
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:38,160
<i>I'm taking you out,</i>

559
01:30:39,667 --> 01:30:46,505
<i>Look, Tyler, maybe you can't see it,
but you've gone round the bend a little,</i>

560
01:30:48,076 --> 01:30:50,476
<i>I know, I've seen it before,</i>

561

<i>I know where your camp is, Tyler,</i>

564
01:31:01,923 --> 01:31:06,553
<i>I'll meet you there in a couple of days,
We'll talk it over,</i>

565
01:31:34,455 --> 01:31:38,414
<i>How could he have known about
Lupus Base unless he'd been there?</i>

566
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:40,791
<i>To get back would be
a three-day hike for me,</i>

567
01:31:40,862 --> 01:31:44,025
<i>but for him, it's only minutes away.</i>

<i>It's pretty lonely around here,</i>

<i>I'm on my way north,

<i>Which is what I'm about to do,</i>

587
01:37:40,888 --> 01:37:45,825
Have you seen the wolves?
Have you seen George and Angie?

588
01:37:45,893 --> 01:37:48,487
<i>No, they must have gone north,</i>

<i>Stop worrying about the pups

<i>This thing that's happening

<i>It's a question of how you survive it,</i>

<i>But it began the moment

600
01:39:51,552 --> 01:39:56,615
<i>By the act of watching them,
