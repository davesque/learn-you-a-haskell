1
00:01:36,794 --> 00:01:39,695
<i>(man) I just jumped at
the opportunity to go,</i>

2
00:01:39,764 --> 00:01:42,130
<i>without even thinking about it, really,</i>

3
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,604
<i>because it opened the way to an old
and very naive childhood fantasy of mine.</i>

4
00:01:47,672 --> 00:01:49,697
<i>To go off into the wilderness</i>

5
00:01:49,774 --> 00:01:54,336
<i>and test myself against
all the dangerous things lurking there.</i>

6
00:01:54,412 --> 00:01:59,941
<i>And to find that basic animal I secretly
hoped was hidden somewhere in myself.</i>

7
00:01:60,017 --> 00:02:04,044
<i>I imagined that at that point
I'd become a new man,</i>

8
00:02:04,122 --> 00:02:08,650
<i>with a strength and courage
that I'd never known before.</i>

9
00:02:11,562 --> 00:02:13,894
<i>As I traveled north,
it was on about the third day</i>

10
00:02:13,965 --> 00:02:18,595
<i>that the reality of what I was about to try
to do began to seep into my bones</i>

11
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:22,332
<i>and gather in a knot
in the pit of my stomach.</i>

12
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:32,179
<i>Then I finally reached
the end of the line, Nootsack.</i>

13
00:02:33,184 --> 00:02:36,950
<i>The sheer bulk of the supplies
the department sent along set me back,</i>

14
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:39,216
<i>as I had to get not only myself
but all this stuff</i>

15
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,157
<i>another 300 miles into the wilderness.</i>

16
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,297
So, you think north of here?

17
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:55,100
<i>The place is crawling with 'em,</i>

18
00:02:55,773 --> 00:02:58,867
<i>But you wouldn't wanna go up there, son,</i>

19
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,870
<i>Got nothing to eat up there now,</i>

20
00:03:02,947 --> 00:03:06,883
<i>There's nothing but ice
and snow and trees and,,,</i>

21
00:03:08,452 --> 00:03:12,047
<i>You would be
the only fresh meat around there,</i>

22
00:03:14,058 --> 00:03:16,549
<i>They'll come after you, son,</i>

23
00:03:17,728 --> 00:03:21,061
<i>Just for the ugly fun of tearing you apart,</i>

24
00:03:28,306 --> 00:03:30,831
<i>I'd heard some of the tales
about the Arctic,</i>

25
00:03:30,908 --> 00:03:36,005
<i>The mad trappers, Diamond Tooth Gertie,
the ice-worm cocktail and all that,</i>

26
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,174
<i>so I was prepared
for things to be a little weird.</i>

27
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,718
<i>You found the bayonets,
I knew you would,</i>

28
00:03:41,786 --> 00:03:43,777
<i>- Charlie,
- (# bassoon playing)</i>

29
00:03:44,622 --> 00:03:49,184
<i>That's much better, much better, Francis,
Keep practicing,</i>

30
00:03:50,194 --> 00:03:53,527
<i>The only plane in Nootsack
belonged to a part-time bush pilot,</i>

31
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:57,625
<i>gambler and real-estate tycoon
named Rosie Little.</i>

32
00:03:57,702 --> 00:03:61,468
<i>While negotiating our deal, he introduced
me to this drink that he'd invented.</i>

33
00:03:61,539 --> 00:04:03,769
<i>Known locally as Moose Juice,</i>

34
00:04:03,841 --> 00:04:08,210
<i>it consisted of equal parts
Moose Brand beer and ethyl alcohol.</i>

35
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:11,510
<i>Before I knew it,
my old fear of flying evaporated,</i>

36
00:04:11,582 --> 00:04:16,952
<i>and I spent all the money I had left
on 24 cases of beer.</i>

37
00:04:25,763 --> 00:04:28,630
<i>T oo much weight, Tyler,</i>

38
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:31,499
Hang on!

39
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:35,096
<i>Whoa,,, Nelly!</i>

40
00:04:42,113 --> 00:04:47,608
<i>Come on, Something else out of there now,
The big, heavy ones, Tyler,</i>

41
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:53,890
<i>I really had no way of knowing
exactly what of the department's gear</i>

42
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,949
<i>we donated to the people of Nootsack.</i>

43
00:04:56,027 --> 00:04:59,485
<i>That big wooden box there,
Get rid of it, Go on, You don't need that,</i>

44
00:04:59,563 --> 00:05:03,863
<i>But by our third attempt at takeoff,
it was a lot of what I might really need.</i>

45
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:09,429
<i>I tried not to think about it.
In fact, I tried not to think at all.</i>

46
00:05:19,684 --> 00:05:23,142
<i>This one is it, I can feel it,</i>

47
00:05:55,619 --> 00:05:60,147
<i>With my eyes still shut,
I realized that I was still alive.</i>

48
00:05:60,224 --> 00:06:02,954
<i>But this was only the beginning.</i>

49
00:07:28,512 --> 00:07:33,279
<i>It's funny how I keep thinking back
to that going-away party.</i>

50
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:37,309
<i>All the toasts by Dr Spivey
and Dr Showwalter,</i>

51
00:07:37,922 --> 00:07:41,449
<i>and everybody singing
old Johnny Horton songs.</i>

52
00:07:41,525 --> 00:07:47,794
<i>And the cake with all the coconut frosting,
with the plastic snowshoes on top.</i>

53
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:57,972
<i>But, then, why me?</i>

54
00:07:60,144 --> 00:08:03,136
<i>Maybe this whole thing was a mistake.</i>

55
00:08:08,085 --> 00:08:12,215
<i>Maybe my name just somehow
got onto the wrong page.</i>

56
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:16,282
<i>It might have been a typo, or maybe
somebody spilled a cup of coffee,</i>

57
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,818
<i>shuffled a couple of pages,
and there I was.</i>

58
00:08:24,168 --> 00:08:29,128
<i>I can 't go on with this. This is suicide.</i>

59
00:08:32,543 --> 00:08:36,707
<i>But I can 't turn around now.
I'd be a laughing stock.</i>

60
00:08:38,148 --> 00:08:43,711
<i>Still, I wouldn 't last six hours down there,
let alone six months.</i>

61
00:08:46,457 --> 00:08:48,448
<i>Uh ,,,</i>

62
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,626
<i>How do you,,,?</i>

63
00:08:52,897 --> 00:08:55,388
<i>Don't worry about a thing,</i>

64
00:08:55,466 --> 00:08:61,063
<i>I feel my way through these mountains
blindfolded all the time,</i>

65
00:09:15,219 --> 00:09:17,551
<i>Tell me, Tyler,,,</i>

66
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:23,492
what's in the Valley of the Blackstone?

67
00:09:23,561 --> 00:09:26,189
What is it? Manganese?

68
00:09:26,697 --> 00:09:28,824
<i>Can't be oil,</i>

69
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:33,126
Is it gold?

70
00:09:33,203 --> 00:09:36,195
<i>It's kind of hard to say,</i>

71
00:09:37,975 --> 00:09:42,742
<i>You're a smart man, Tyler,
Keep your own counsel,</i>

72
00:09:42,813 --> 00:09:46,715
We're all of us prospectors
up here, eh, Tyler?

73
00:09:48,786 --> 00:09:53,450
Scratching for that one crack in the ground

74
00:09:53,524 --> 00:09:56,789
<i>so we'll never have to scratch again,</i>

75
00:09:58,362 --> 00:09:61,354
<i>I'll let you in on a little secret, Tyler,</i>

76
00:09:61,432 --> 00:10:03,923
<i>The gold's not in the ground,</i>

77
00:10:05,035 --> 00:10:07,936
<i>The gold's not anywhere up here,</i>

78
00:10:08,005 --> 00:10:10,769
<i>The real gold is south of 60,</i>

79
00:10:10,841 --> 00:10:17,076
<i>Sittin' in living rooms,
stuck facing the boob tube, bored to death,</i>

80
00:10:17,147 --> 00:10:19,672
Bored to death, Tyler!

81
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,742
<i>(clunking)</i>

82
00:10:24,121 --> 00:10:26,112
Ah.

83
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:30,624
<i>(engine splutters)</i>

84
00:10:33,631 --> 00:10:35,929
<i>- (screeching)
- What was that?</i>

85
00:10:37,868 --> 00:10:39,859
<i>(rapid bleeping)</i>

86
00:10:41,505 --> 00:10:43,496
Oh, Lord!

87
00:10:44,808 --> 00:10:46,139
Darn!

88
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,644
<i>- What's wrong?
- Take the stick,</i>

89
00:10:61,058 --> 00:11:02,753
Arrrrgh!

90
00:11:04,028 --> 00:11:06,019
What's wrong?

91
00:11:10,434 --> 00:11:13,301
<i>Boredom, Tyler,</i>

92
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,838
<i>Boredom, that's what's wrong,</i>

93
00:11:15,906 --> 00:11:18,898
And how do you beat boredom, Tyler?

94
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,301
Adventure.

95
00:11:23,614 --> 00:11:25,707
Adventure, Tyler.

96
00:11:27,384 --> 00:11:29,545
Where are you going? Rosie!

97
00:11:30,287 --> 00:11:33,779
<i>Rosie, what are you doing?
I can't fly this thing, What do I do?</i>

98
00:11:33,857 --> 00:11:36,985
<i>Catch the updraft there, Tyler, That's it,</i>

99
00:11:37,061 --> 00:11:39,393
<i>Right in the middle, Good,</i>

100
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,062
<i>- Oh!
- Ah!</i>

101
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,106
Tyler, easy, easy, easy!

102
00:11:52,176 --> 00:11:56,010
<i>- Back the other way! Turn it the other way!
- What?</i>

103
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,878
<i>Tyler, back, Tyler! Tyler!</i>

104
00:11:58,949 --> 00:11:61,509
Easy! Tyler!

105
00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:04,917
<i>The other way, That's it,</i>

106
00:12:04,988 --> 00:12:07,149
<i>That's it, Good, Tyler,</i>

107
00:12:07,224 --> 00:12:10,022
<i>That's it, You learn fast,</i>

108
00:12:14,565 --> 00:12:16,556
<i>(engine starts)</i>

109
00:12:32,983 --> 00:12:34,974
<i>(Rosie) Whoo!</i>

110
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:26,529
<i>Rosie, it's freezing,</i>

111
00:13:26,603 --> 00:13:29,766
<i>Keep moving, Tyler, Gotta keep moving,</i>

112
00:13:31,008 --> 00:13:32,771
<i>(smashing)</i>

113
00:13:32,843 --> 00:13:38,008
<i>- You'll be fine,
- Gotta take it easy with some of this stuff,</i>

114
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:40,640
<i>Oh, uh,,,</i>

115
00:13:40,717 --> 00:13:43,242
Mind your toes!

116
00:13:44,054 --> 00:13:47,490
<i>Speed, Speed is of the essence, Tyler,</i>

117
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:51,526
<i>Especially when you don't know
how much fuel you got,</i>

118
00:13:51,595 --> 00:13:54,155
<i>(smashing)</i>

119
00:13:57,835 --> 00:14:02,636
<i>You got any last messages for the world,
Tyler, you better let me have 'em now,</i>

120
00:14:08,312 --> 00:14:12,305
<i>That's sneaky, Tyler, Very sneaky,</i>

121
00:14:17,588 --> 00:14:19,715
<i>Wait, Rosie! Rosie!</i>

122
00:14:24,127 --> 00:14:26,118
<i>- Rosie,
- What?</i>

123
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:30,332
Hey?

124
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,198
Remember my position, will you?

125
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:36,831
<i>Sure, I'll stop by
for a drink sometime, huh?</i>

126
00:14:42,346 --> 00:14:44,780
Rosie! Rosie!

127
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,217
What?

128
00:14:49,286 --> 00:14:53,916
<i>- What is my position?
- It beats the hell out of me, Tyler,</i>

129
00:14:53,991 --> 00:14:57,358
<i>I just hope I can find my way home,</i>

130
00:14:57,427 --> 00:14:59,691
<i>Good luck, Tyler,</i>

131
00:14:59,763 --> 00:14:61,390
<i>Yeah,</i>

132
00:16:34,024 --> 00:16:36,686
<i>Well, interesting.</i>

133
00:16:42,099 --> 00:16:45,262
<i>Now, what are the possibilities here?</i>

134
00:16:47,404 --> 00:16:49,395
<i>The possibilities...</i>

135
00:16:57,214 --> 00:16:59,409
<i>are many.</i>

136
00:17:02,285 --> 00:17:06,881
<i>Gotta stay rational, be objective and. . .</i>

137
00:17:08,191 --> 00:17:13,322
<i>plan out all the proper procedures
before doing anything else.</i>

138
00:17:13,397 --> 00:17:19,825
<i>Make a list of priorities, remembering,
of course, to take into account variables,</i>

139
00:17:19,903 --> 00:17:25,205
<i>and the fact that, inevitably,
some problems could arise that. . .</i>

140
00:17:27,644 --> 00:17:33,640
<i>. . . inevitably, some problems could arise
that are completely unexpected.</i>

141
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:44,558
<i>Get a grip on yourself.</i>

142
00:17:57,207 --> 00:17:60,973
<i>Section 3C of my instructions
reads as follows:</i>

143

<i>''You will proceed immediately, by means
of canoe and utilizing local waterways,</i>

144

<i>Excuse me, You sort of,,,</i>

177
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:54,259
Could you give me a hand
with some of this equipment, I wonder?

178

Ya!

<i>I've decided to stay here

<i>For the first time in three days
I emerge from my sleeping bag</i>

192

<i>and begin trying to do my job.</i>

193
00:29:53,089 --> 00:29:55,853
<i>So far I've collected
the following specimens:</i>

194
00:29:55,925 --> 00:29:59,088
<i>five baby mice, one millipede</i>

195
00:29:59,162 --> 00:30:02,529
<i>and something that looks
suspiciously like fleas.</i>

196
00:30:02,598 --> 00:30:06,261
<i>My instructions are to track down
a specimen of Canis lupus,</i>

197
00:30:06,335 --> 00:30:11,534
<i>dispatch it with a rifle
and examine the contents of its stomach.</i>

<i>April 1 6.</i>

203
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:50,850
<i>Warm days bring
a kind of peace and stillness.</i>

204
00:33:50,926 --> 00:33:52,917
<i>If there are any remaining fears,</i>

205
00:33:52,995 --> 00:33:58,991
<i>they stem only from the recognition
of my own staggering insignificance.</i>

206
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,842
<i>(distant howling)</i>

207
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,651
<i>(howling continues)</i>

208

<i>May 3. In pursuit of phantoms.</i>

<i>I hear them every night, have seen
their tracks and collected their scat.</i>

210
00:34:43,612 --> 00:34:46,103
<i>So they must be real.</i>

211
00:35:03,566 --> 00:35:05,557

<i>The largest and rarest of the wolf species.</i>

215
00:36:33,389 --> 00:36:35,721
<i>And its den.</i>

216
00:36:54,843 --> 00:36:58,802
<i>The rules of the game are to choose
an observation post downwind,</i>

217

<i>out of the animal's field of vision,</i>

218

<i>gain your position and maintain it
without ever revealing your presence.</i>

219
00:37:14,997 --> 00:37:19,661
<i>Outmaneuvered on all counts,
I opt to change the rules.</i>

220

<i>(pans clanking)</i>

<i>Reasoning that we're suspicious

00:37:27,176 --> 00:37:30,270
<i>I decide to reveal
as much as possible about myself,</i>

<i>(wolf grunts)</i>

225
00:38:08,851 --> 00:38:11,752
<i>I haven't seen the wolf in two days.</i>

226
00:38:12,554 --> 00:38:18,424
<i>I know I was violating the distance
principle, moving so far into his territory.</i>

227
00:38:18,494 --> 00:38:22,988
<i>But since he hadn't seemed afraid of me,
I hoped that I could. . .</i>

<i>I didn't take it personally.</i>

233
00:39:40,242 --> 00:39:44,235
<i>This was a matter of principle,
a territorial dispute.</i>

234
00:39:44,313 --> 00:39:47,009
<i>And he had fired the first shot.</i>

235
00:39:47,082 --> 00:39:49,346
# What never?
No, never

236
00:39:49,852 --> 00:39:51,786

<i>27 cups of tea later, I completed
a two-acre circle around my tent,</i>

252

<i>including a 100-yard section
of the wolf's path.</i>

253
00:41:43,165 --> 00:41:46,601
<i>What had taken me six hours
and 27 cups of tea,</i>

254
00:41:46,668 --> 00:41:50,263
<i>he accomplished in just a few minutes.</i>

255
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:54,435
<i>At each of the places that I'd marked,
he made his mark on the opposite side,</i>

256
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:58,378
<i>indicating that my boundary
was acceptable to him.</i>

257
00:42:05,354 --> 00:42:09,518
<i>And thus he granted me the space
for Lupus Base One.</i>

258
00:43:19,461 --> 00:43:22,328
<i>I'm supposed to watch his behavior,</i>

259
00:43:22,397 --> 00:43:27,334
<i>but all he does is stay
in front of his den and watch mine.</i>

260
00:43:27,402 --> 00:43:32,999
<i>I can't remember ever being the object
of so much constant attention.</i>

261
00:43:44,953 --> 00:43:47,285
<i>I now arise at 1 0: 00 in the evening,</i>

262

<i>as everything becomes more active
during the long polar twilight.</i>

263
00:43:52,494 --> 00:43:55,952
<i>In my notebook,
the wolf has become George.</i>

264
00:44:17,686 --> 00:44:19,916
<i>The two are identical in color,</i>

265
00:44:19,988 --> 00:44:24,448
<i>with the same contrasting
shoulder marking and long-legged gait.</i>

266
00:44:24,526 --> 00:44:29,520
<i>But I've detected a difference,
and I've named her Angeline.</i>

267
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:50,810
<i>As George has become a family of five,</i>

268
00:44:50,886 --> 00:44:56,188
<i>the reason for his long staring match
with me has lost its mystery.</i>

269
00:45:38,567 --> 00:45:43,004
<i>It's well-known that wolves mate for life,
but knowing that has hardly prepared me</i>

270
00:45:43,071 --> 00:45:47,007
<i>for their constant and varied
displays of affection.</i>

271
00:45:47,075 --> 00:45:50,806
<i>Every evening George goes off
on his nightly rounds.</i>

272
00:45:50,879 --> 00:45:54,940
<i>What he does on these excursions
remains a mystery to me.</i>

273
00:45:55,016 --> 00:45:57,746
<i>Angeline always remains
behind with the cubs,</i>

274
00:45:57,819 --> 00:45:61,311

279
00:46:61,650 --> 00:47:04,118
<i>It's perplexing.</i>

280
00:47:04,186 --> 00:47:07,883
<i>The overall reason behind the study
is that the government wants final proof</i>

281
00:47:07,956 --> 00:47:13,588
<i>that wolves are responsible
for the disastrous decline in caribou.</i>

282
00:47:13,662 --> 00:47:21,000
<i>So far I haven 't seen a single caribou,
or observed the wolves eating anything.</i>

283
00:47:21,069 --> 00:47:23,697
<i>My own food supplies
are nearing exhaustion,</i>

284
00:47:23,772 --> 00:47:27,435
<i>and the local environment
offers scant pickings.</i>

285
00:47:27,509 --> 00:47:31,240
<i>Yet the wolves seem perfectly healthy.</i>

286
00:47:31,313 --> 00:47:33,474
<i>I've done numerous scatological studies</i>

287
00:47:33,548 --> 00:47:37,245
<i>and only turned up a smattering
of small mammal bones.</i>

288
00:47:37,319 --> 00:47:39,981
<i>The whole question of sustenance
around Lupus Base One</i>

289
00:47:40,055 --> 00:47:42,888

<i>(scuttling)</i>

294
00:48:49,457 --> 00:48:51,891
<i>Angeline has given me the first clue.</i>

295
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:56,090
<i>In less than an hour
she's caught and consumed 23 mice.</i>

296
00:48:56,164 --> 00:48:59,656
<i>My rough calculation:
one mouse every ten square feet.</i>

297
00:48:59,734 --> 00:49:02,760
<i>Over 40,000 square feet in an acre.</i>

298
00:49:02,837 --> 00:49:05,931
<i>That's 4,000 mice per acre.</i>

299
00:49:14,816 --> 00:49:17,614
<i>The idea that a large animal
could live entirely on mice</i>

300
00:49:17,686 --> 00:49:20,382
<i>will be greeted with skepticism,</i>

301
00:49:20,455 --> 00:49:23,720

<i>I expected one of the pack battles
I'd read so much about.</i>

315
00:53:39,914 --> 00:53:42,246
<i>It was Angie who was
right in the middle of things,</i>

316
00:53:42,317 --> 00:53:45,809
<i>asserting her position
as the dominant female.</i>

317
00:53:45,887 --> 00:53:48,481
<i>The challenges and assertions
were mostly symbolic.</i>

318
00:53:48,556 --> 00:53:50,547
<i>There was no real fighting.</i>

319
00:53:50,625 --> 00:53:53,389
<i>But Angeline got her point across.</i>

320
00:53:54,195 --> 00:53:56,026
<i>George was never challenged.</i>

321
00:53:56,097 --> 00:53:58,793
<i>He just stood there
with his air of masterful certainty,</i>

322
00:53:58,867 --> 00:53:61,495
<i>the alpha wolf of the pack.</i>

323
00:53:61,569 --> 00:54:04,367
<i>Usually, only the dominant pair
mate and have offspring,</i>

324
00:54:04,439 --> 00:54:07,499
<i>going to seek their own privacy
for that purpose.</i>

325
00:54:07,575 --> 00:54:11,807
<i>Apparently, the time had arrived
to rejoin the pack.</i>

326
00:54:40,175 --> 00:54:44,509
<i>There's a young brown wolf who seems
to be a particular favorite of the cubs.</i>

327
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:47,173
<i>I've named him Uncle Albert.</i>

328
00:54:51,686 --> 00:54:56,817
<i>Now Angeline is free again
to join George on his nightly rounds.</i>

329
00:55:28,189 --> 00:55:30,180
<i>July 1 2.</i>

330
00:55:32,193 --> 00:55:37,062
<i>I wonder why it was that long ago
I became a watcher of things.</i>

331
00:55:37,132 --> 00:55:41,933
<i>Always watching others do and feel things
I wouldn't or couldn't do myself.</i>

332
00:55:43,705 --> 00:55:48,972
<i>Always standing off at a distance,
isolated, detached.</i>

333
00:55:50,879 --> 00:55:54,645
<i>I envy the wolves
for how they experience the world.</i>

334
00:55:54,716 --> 00:55:57,310
<i>Always in such direct contact
with their environment,</i>

335
00:55:57,385 --> 00:55:59,376
<i>traveling through their territories,</i>

336
00:55:59,454 --> 00:56:04,050
<i>alert and attuned to all the signs
coming in through their senses,</i>

337
00:56:04,125 --> 00:56:08,357
<i>telling them where a rabbit

338
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:12,958
<i>revealing a whole universe to them
that we can never really know.</i>

339
00:56:17,005 --> 00:56:22,705
<i>But I sit behind glass lenses,
filling up notebooks and triplicate forms,</i>

340
00:56:22,777 --> 00:56:28,079
<i>trying to capture the wolves
within the pages of my journal.</i>

341
00:56:28,149 --> 00:56:31,744
<i>And what'll be done with the study
when I'm finished?</i>

342
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:35,620
<i>Once these wolves
have been exposed to my world. . .</i>

343
00:56:36,357 --> 00:56:39,190
<i>what will happen to them ?</i>

344
00:56:58,546 --> 00:57:02,573
<i>There's a strange wolf
that I only see fleetingly.</i>

345
00:57:04,152 --> 00:57:08,248
<i>He must be part of the pack,
but an outsider,</i>

346
00:57:08,323 --> 00:57:10,985
<i>always following at a distance.</i>

347
00:57:12,427 --> 00:57:15,089
<i>Perhaps another watcher.</i>

348
00:58:27,602 --> 00:58:30,230
<i>(high-pitched bird call)</i>

349
00:58:30,305 --> 00:58:32,296
Oh!

350
00:59:02,737 --> 00:59:05,706
<i>Ootek thought you might need
some company,</i>

351
00:59:07,041 --> 00:59:08,633
Ootek?

352
00:59:13,014 --> 00:59:15,005
<i>Hello,</i>

353
00:59:29,731 --> 00:59:32,427
<i>Really can't tell you how glad I am
to see the two of you,</i>

354
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:36,163
<i>It's been so long
since I heard another human voice,</i>

355
00:59:36,771 --> 00:59:39,103
You have any ketchup here?

356
00:59:39,841 --> 00:59:43,777
<i>No, I don't, I'm sorry,
I ran out a couple of weeks ago,</i>

357
00:59:43,845 --> 00:59:46,336
<i>Here, have some fish,</i>

358
00:59:48,683 --> 00:59:50,548
<i>Uh, no,</i>

359
00:59:50,618 --> 00:59:53,109
<i>No, thanks, I don't eat fish,</i>

360
00:59:55,923 --> 00:59:58,255
What do you eat?

361
00:59:58,726 --> 00:59:60,717
<i>Actually,,,</i>

362
00:59:61,896 --> 01:00:04,057
<i>I eat mice,</i>

363
01:00:06,234 --> 01:00:09,533
<i>- You eat mice?
- Yeah,</i>

364
01:00:14,008 --> 01:00:16,499
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

365
01:00:18,913 --> 01:00:21,711
<i>It's an experiment, really,</i>

366
01:00:21,783 --> 01:00:25,549
<i>You see, the wolves are supposed to eat
caribou, However, there are no caribou,</i>

367
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:28,145
<i>Basically, what the wolves
have been eating is mice,</i>

368
01:00:28,222 --> 01:00:32,921
So I'm conducting an experiment
to see whether a carnivore, a big animal,

369
01:00:32,994 --> 01:00:35,053
<i>can live on nothing but mice,</i>

370
01:00:35,129 --> 01:00:39,566
<i>So I've been just eating mice,
and I'm doing fine,</i>

371
01:00:43,337 --> 01:00:45,328
<i>(translates)</i>

372
01:01:03,558 --> 01:01:07,722
<i>- What does he say?
- He says, "Good idea,"</i>

373
01:01:11,933 --> 01:01:14,595
<i>(two men speak native language)</i>

374
01:01:18,439 --> 01:01:20,634
<i>(Tyler) Syringe,</i>

375
01:01:20,708 --> 01:01:22,699
<i>There,</i>

376
01:01:30,384 --> 01:01:34,844
<i>- What's that?
- Clamp, This thing? Yeah,</i>

377
01:01:34,922 --> 01:01:36,981
See the way this is set up here?

378
01:01:37,058 --> 01:01:40,653
<i>This is so it grabs ahold, You got him,</i>

379
01:01:40,728 --> 01:01:42,719
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

380
01:01:43,898 --> 01:01:46,128
<i>It's a gripper,</i>

381
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,430
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

382
01:01:48,503 --> 01:01:51,097
<i>I know what that is,
They had them at the mines,</i>

383
01:01:51,172 --> 01:01:55,700
<i>Yeah, that's right, It's a gas mask,
except that I use it for wolf scats,</i>

384
01:01:55,777 --> 01:01:61,181
<i>The wolf scat has little tiny animals,
little tiny parasites,</i>

385
01:01:61,249 --> 01:02:04,776
And if you breathe these things in,
you breathe these little guys,

386
01:02:04,852 --> 01:02:09,448
<i>they go up into your brain
and they eat it out,</i>

387
01:02:09,524 --> 01:02:11,890
Scat? What is scat?

388
01:02:12,326 --> 01:02:13,918
<i>Uh,,,</i>

389
01:02:13,995 --> 01:02:16,054
<i>Wolf droppings,</i>

390
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:20,328
See, the idea behind this is
if you study what comes out of a wolf,

391
01:02:20,401 --> 01:02:23,768
<i>you get a pretty good idea what went in,</i>

392
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:25,669
<i>Hmm,</i>

393
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:29,801
<i>I got a whole bag of them down there,
I got a whole sack,</i>

394
01:02:29,877 --> 01:02:31,868
<i>(translates)</i>

395
01:02:39,787 --> 01:02:42,119
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

396
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:47,951
What did he say?

397
01:02:48,029 --> 01:02:50,759
<i>He says, "Good idea,"</i>

398
01:03:10,985 --> 01:03:12,976
<i>(howling)</i>

399
01:03:21,529 --> 01:03:23,520
<i>(howling continues)</i>

400
01:03:30,705 --> 01:03:33,037
<i>(speak native language)</i>

401
01:03:44,785 --> 01:03:48,653
<i>And so they settled in with me,
as if nothing could be more natural.</i>

402
01:03:53,027 --> 01:03:56,463
<i>For my part,
I'm glad to have the company.</i>

403
01:03:56,530 --> 01:03:58,521
<i>A seven,</i>

404
01:04:02,436 --> 01:04:04,427
<i>Mike had gone to school in the south.</i>

405
01:04:04,505 --> 01:04:06,905
<i>When his parents died,
Ootek adopted him.</i>

406
01:04:06,974 --> 01:04:10,933
<i>Traditionally, they are no orphans
among the Inuit.</i>

407
01:04:11,012 --> 01:04:13,503
<i>(plays stilted tune)</i>

408
01:04:24,659 --> 01:04:27,856
I met a girl in a bar,

409
01:04:27,929 --> 01:04:31,057
<i>and she wanted me to buy her drinks,
so I bought her some,</i>

410
01:04:31,132 --> 01:04:35,466
<i>And then after a while,
she wanted to come home with me,</i>

411
01:04:35,536 --> 01:04:39,632
<i>But I made a mistake,</i>

412
01:04:39,707 --> 01:04:42,369
<i>I smiled at her,</i>

413
01:04:43,144 --> 01:04:47,740
<i>That's what happens when a meat eater
becomes a sugar eater,</i>

414
01:05:02,263 --> 01:05:05,460
<i>Ootek has taken
a particular interest in the study,</i>

415
01:05:05,533 --> 01:05:11,961
<i>though I've learned there is little about
wolves that he doesn 't already know.</i>

416
01:05:18,479 --> 01:05:21,243
<i>But I sense there is another side to Ootek,</i>

417
01:05:21,315 --> 01:05:24,250
<i>some part of his nature
that he hasn 't shown.</i>

418
01:05:24,318 --> 01:05:26,479
<i>I try not to annoy him
with too many questions,</i>

419
01:05:26,554 --> 01:05:29,921
<i>but there are many things I'd like to know.</i>

420
01:05:56,117 --> 01:05:58,449
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

421
01:06:03,924 --> 01:06:07,690
<i>When he was young
he used to follow the wolves on their hunts,</i>

422
01:06:09,096 --> 01:06:11,428
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

423
01:06:14,368 --> 01:06:18,065
<i>The wolf is his helping spirit: amarok.</i>

424
01:06:20,908 --> 01:06:23,741
<i>- Ama...
- Amarok.</i>

425
01:06:23,811 --> 01:06:25,802
<i>- Ama...
- The wolf,</i>

426
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,371
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

427
01:06:39,193 --> 01:06:44,495
<i>He went 30 days without food
and without protection from the cold,</i>

428
01:06:51,705 --> 01:06:54,196
<i>Then he saw the wolf,</i>

429
01:06:61,749 --> 01:07:05,742
<i>He felt the wolf bite into his heart,</i>

430
01:07:12,326 --> 01:07:17,127
<i>When he woke up, he was all in one piece,</i>

431
01:07:19,033 --> 01:07:23,436
<i>That's how the wolf
became his helping spirit,</i>

432
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:37,841
<i>(howling)</i>

433
01:08:27,635 --> 01:08:30,866
<i>I wonder what makes them howl like that,</i>

434
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:36,332
<i>They howl when they're lonely,</i>

435
01:08:38,812 --> 01:08:41,303
<i>Or to call their friends,</i>

436
01:08:43,384 --> 01:08:47,878
<i>That way, the other,,,
the others will know where they are,</i>

437
01:08:47,955 --> 01:08:51,891
<i>and then sooner or later
they're bound to meet up,</i>

438
01:08:55,095 --> 01:08:59,259
<i>That's the way to catch wolves,
Go where they're howling,</i>

439
01:08:59,333 --> 01:09:02,302
Hide behind a rock,

440
01:09:02,369 --> 01:09:04,735
<i>and then howl like one of them,</i>

441
01:09:04,805 --> 01:09:09,242
<i>And then,,, they will come to investigate,</i>

442
01:09:11,912 --> 01:09:14,244
Yeah?

443
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:20,183
<i>When they get close enough,
you shoot 'em,</i>

444
01:09:22,423 --> 01:09:25,517
<i>You shoot 'em,
Hopefully you hit 'em,</i>

445
01:09:31,732 --> 01:09:34,394
<i>That's how you kill a wolf,</i>

446
01:09:41,442 --> 01:09:44,673
<i>To me, wolves mean money,</i>

447
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:49,408
<i>It's a way of making a living,</i>

448
01:09:52,119 --> 01:09:57,352
<i>One wolf pelt costs about $350,</i>

449
01:10:02,429 --> 01:10:04,863
And I'vegottofeed myfamily.

450
01:10:04,932 --> 01:10:06,923
<i>My children,</i>

451
01:10:08,235 --> 01:10:11,204
Buy a snowmobile,

452
01:10:11,272 --> 01:10:14,867
<i>food, rifle, bullets, whatever,</i>

453
01:10:20,481 --> 01:10:22,972
<i>You wouldn't,,,</i>

454
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:25,712
I mean, you wouldn't kill these wolves?

455
01:10:25,786 --> 01:10:28,118
<i>These ones? Oh,</i>

456
01:10:29,423 --> 01:10:31,823
<i>No, I don't think so,</i>

457
01:10:31,892 --> 01:10:36,488
<i>Besides, you would get mad
if I killed one of them,</i>

458
01:10:36,563 --> 01:10:39,555
<i>And your gun is bigger than mine,</i>

459
01:10:44,838 --> 01:10:47,136
<i>Yeah,</i>

460
01:10:48,409 --> 01:10:50,900
<i>I'd like to, though,</i>

461
01:11:12,099 --> 01:11:14,693
<i>Last week in August.</i>

462
01:11:14,768 --> 01:11:18,568
<i>The Arctic summer has almost ended.</i>

463
01:11:18,639 --> 01:11:24,874
<i>As the time grows short, I'm reluctant to
even sleep, for fear of missing something.</i>

464
01:11:24,945 --> 01:11:28,904
<i>It's hard to imagine
that soon I'll have to leave.</i>

465
01:11:28,982 --> 01:11:32,645
<i>But this place doesn 't belong to man.
It belongs to the wolves.</i>

466
01:11:35,089 --> 01:11:39,321
<i>I can't really be sad, because it's here
that I've begun to feel wonder again,</i>

467
01:11:39,393 --> 01:11:43,853
<i>like when I was a kid,
and this makes me deeply happy.</i>

468
01:11:44,865 --> 01:11:50,963
<i>I wish I could say thank so,
just so, straight into the universe.</i>

469
01:12:16,730 --> 01:12:19,824
<i>The rest of Ootek's family,
traveling through on their way north,</i>

470
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:22,391
<i>stopped by to spend the night.</i>

471
01:12:35,649 --> 01:12:38,140
<i>(Ootek speaks native language)</i>

472
01:12:42,823 --> 01:12:46,987
He wants me to tell you a story
of when there was nothing in the world

473
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:50,518
<i>except for a man and a woman,</i>

474
01:12:50,597 --> 01:12:53,259
The woman came to a hole in the ice,

475
01:12:53,333 --> 01:12:59,272
<i>and she reached in and felt something,
so she pulled it out,</i>

476
01:12:60,073 --> 01:13:03,042
<i>And itwasatuktu,which isthecaribou.</i>

477
01:13:04,011 --> 01:13:09,472
<i>And it was this animal that the lnuit
needed for their food and clothing,</i>

478
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:16,854
<i>For many years there were so many
caribou that the people called them lice,</i>

479
01:13:16,924 --> 01:13:21,623
But soon all the hunting killed off
all the fat, healthy animals,

480
01:13:21,695 --> 01:13:26,723
<i>and the only ones left over
were the weak, sick ones,</i>

481
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:30,759
Soon they began to breed and multiply,

482
01:13:32,039 --> 01:13:35,031
<i>and the herd got weak,</i>

483
01:13:37,377 --> 01:13:39,174
<i>Sick,</i>

484
01:13:44,017 --> 01:13:46,485
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

485
01:13:50,924 --> 01:13:56,487
<i>So the people came back to the woman
to ask her what to do,</i>

486
01:13:56,563 --> 01:13:59,464
She went back to the hole in the ice,

487
01:13:59,533 --> 01:14:04,300
because she needed a tool
to cut the sickness out of the herd,

488
01:14:04,371 --> 01:14:07,135
<i>and the amarok was born,</i>

489
01:14:09,343 --> 01:14:11,334
<i>Amarok.</i>

490
01:14:13,113 --> 01:14:18,608
The wolves hunted the caribou
and they killed off all the weak, sick ones,

491
01:14:19,353 --> 01:14:23,551
<i>and the people had
all the caribou that they needed,</i>

492
01:14:23,624 --> 01:14:25,956
<i>(speak native language)</i>

493
01:14:39,139 --> 01:14:43,235
<i>She says maybe you're like Ootek,</i>

494
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:46,802
<i>Maybe a long time ago
the wolf devoured you,</i>

495
01:14:51,985 --> 01:14:54,317
<i>(distant howl)</i>

496
01:14:57,357 --> 01:14:59,348

<i>(speaks native language)</i>

499
01:15:22,783 --> 01:15:25,183
He knows, doesn't he?

500
01:15:26,186 --> 01:15:29,087
<i>He knows what they're saying,</i>

501
01:15:29,156 --> 01:15:34,093
The caribou are coming south
and the hunting will be good,

502
01:15:34,161 --> 01:15:36,959
<i>and the amarok will be there,</i>

503
01:16:21,475 --> 01:16:24,103
<i>We broke camp
and went in separate directions.</i>

504
01:16:24,177 --> 01:16:27,840
<i>Mike went south, while Ootek
led me on a three-day trek,</i>

505
01:16:27,914 --> 01:16:31,247
<i>down out of the high country
and on to the tundra.</i>

506
01:16:31,318 --> 01:16:34,549
<i>There will be wolves there,
he said, as well as the ''tuktu'',</i>

507
01:16:34,621 --> 01:16:39,456
<i>the great caribou herds
that once had sustained his people.</i>

508
01:17:26,473 --> 01:17:29,033
<i>His endurance
is very much greater than mine,</i>

509
01:17:29,109 --> 01:17:31,600
<i>but there are no expectations of me.</i>

510
01:17:31,678 --> 01:17:35,409
<i>Not, I think, because I am the ''kabloona, ''
the white man,</i>

511
01:17:35,482 --> 01:17:39,612
<i>but because he doesn 't recognize
such a thing as impatience.</i>

512
01:17:39,686 --> 01:17:42,154
<i>(thunder)</i>

513
01:17:42,222 --> 01:17:44,213
<i>(chanting)</i>

514
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:53,148
Whoo!

515
01:20:12,772 --> 01:20:14,763
<i>(caribou grunting)</i>

516
01:25:44,704 --> 01:25:49,300
<i>Deep in the bone,
the marrow reveals the disease.</i>

517
01:25:49,375 --> 01:25:53,744
<i>And she had found the tool
to cut the sickness from the herd.</i>

518
01:26:05,491 --> 01:26:07,482
<i>(chanting)</i>

519
01:26:51,537 --> 01:26:53,528
<i>(distant gunshots)</i>

520
01:27:08,988 --> 01:27:12,446
<i>Gunfire and the smell of gasoline.</i>

521
01:27:12,525 --> 01:27:14,516
<i>(laughter)</i>

522
01:27:18,531 --> 01:27:20,522
<i>(music on radio)</i>

523
01:27:34,013 --> 01:27:36,345
Come on, right over here!

524
01:27:47,293 --> 01:27:49,022
<i>Hello, Rosie,</i>

525
01:27:51,097 --> 01:27:53,292
Is that you, Tyler?

526
01:27:55,168 --> 01:27:58,035
<i>They called off the search,
They wrote you off,</i>

527
01:27:58,104 --> 01:27:61,505
<i>I even said a few Hail Marys for you myself,</i>

528
01:27:61,574 --> 01:28:05,169
<i>But I never believed in ghosts,
How are you?</i>

529
01:28:05,244 --> 01:28:10,409
<i>- You all right? You got all your pieces?
- I'm all right, yeah,</i>

530
01:28:10,483 --> 01:28:13,475
<i>- You've changed,
- I've changed?</i>

531
01:28:16,923 --> 01:28:21,155
What the hell you been
doing out here, anyway?

532
01:28:21,227 --> 01:28:25,926
<i>Tyler, you wouldn't believe what's
happened, It's fantastic, I hit the jackpot,</i>

533
01:28:25,998 --> 01:28:28,125
<i>Two new planes, a new hotel,</i>

534
01:28:28,201 --> 01:28:30,601
Have you seen an old lnuk?

535
01:28:30,670 --> 01:28:34,800
Inuk? Eskimo? Drunk or sober?

536
01:28:34,874 --> 01:28:36,705
<i>Quite sober,</i>

537
01:28:39,512 --> 01:28:41,844
<i>Join the party,</i>

538
01:28:49,822 --> 01:28:53,087
Altogether, 1400acres.

539
01:28:53,159 --> 01:28:57,619
<i>Top of the mountain down to the lake,
including mineral rights,</i>

540
01:28:57,697 --> 01:29:02,964
<i>But the real ace in the hole for us right now
is the hot spring right up there,</i>

541
01:29:03,035 --> 01:29:06,596
<i>Amazing, lncredible, Steaming hot water
coming right out of the ground,</i>

542
01:29:06,672 --> 01:29:09,971
When I say hot water,
what are you thinking?

543
01:29:10,042 --> 01:29:12,374
Sitting in the bath tub?

544
01:29:13,579 --> 01:29:18,573
<i>Japanese, A little bit of advertising,
plenty of raw fish,</i>

545
01:29:20,553 --> 01:29:23,613
<i>Beautiful country all right,</i>

546
01:29:23,689 --> 01:29:26,180
<i>Limitless possibilities,</i>

547
01:29:27,226 --> 01:29:30,787
<i>Japanese, That's a great angle, Rosie,</i>

548
01:29:32,465 --> 01:29:35,434
<i>Wait, You haven't heard the best part,
Listen to this,</i>

549
01:29:35,501 --> 01:29:40,837
Once they've soaked their little buns
in our magic, medicinal hot spring,

550
01:29:40,907 --> 01:29:44,240
<i>you bottle it up, stick a fancy label on it,
they take it home with them,</i>

551
01:29:44,310 --> 01:29:47,006
<i>Before you know it, we'll be
shipping it outta here by the truckload,</i>

552
01:29:47,079 --> 01:29:52,244
<i>And what does it cost us? Nothing,
Just bubbles right out of the ground,</i>

553
01:29:52,318 --> 01:29:55,048
<i>I bet you we could figure out a way
to bottle the air up here, too,</i>

554
01:29:55,121 --> 01:29:57,555
<i>Fantastic,</i>

555
01:29:57,623 --> 01:29:60,615
<i>Gentlemen, here's to the future,</i>

556
01:30:19,312 --> 01:30:21,303
<i>Watch the horns,</i>

557
01:30:34,293 --> 01:30:37,353
<i>Come on, Tyler, Climb in,</i>

558
01:30:37,430 --> 01:30:40,160
<i>I'm taking you out,</i>

559
01:30:41,667 --> 01:30:48,505
<i>Look, Tyler, maybe you can't see it,
but you've gone round the bend a little,</i>

560
01:30:50,076 --> 01:30:52,476
<i>I know, I've seen it before,</i>

561
01:30:52,545 --> 01:30:54,877
<i>Come on, Get in the,,,</i>

562
01:30:55,715 --> 01:30:58,377
<i>(chuckles)</i>

563
01:30:59,852 --> 01:31:02,616
<i>I know where your camp is, Tyler,</i>

564
01:31:03,923 --> 01:31:08,553
<i>I'll meet you there in a couple of days,
We'll talk it over,</i>

565
01:31:36,455 --> 01:31:40,414
<i>How could he have known about
Lupus Base unless he'd been there?</i>

566
01:31:40,493 --> 01:31:42,791
<i>To get back would be
a three-day hike for me,</i>

567
01:31:42,862 --> 01:31:46,025
<i>but for him, it's only minutes away.</i>

568
01:32:47,994 --> 01:32:49,985
<i>(whining)</i>

569
01:32:54,734 --> 01:32:56,725
<i>(whining)</i>

570
01:33:11,050 --> 01:33:13,541
Pups, where's your folks?

571
01:33:18,090 --> 01:33:20,820
<i>It's pretty lonely around here,</i>

572
01:33:23,729 --> 01:33:29,133
<i>Don't you worry about anything,
Everything's gonna be just fine,</i>

573
01:33:29,201 --> 01:33:31,795
<i>(plane overhead)</i>

574
01:35:12,171 --> 01:35:14,162
Get outta there!

575
01:35:15,541 --> 01:35:20,569
Get out of here, Rosie!
I don't want you here! Get out of here!

576
01:35:21,547 --> 01:35:23,708
Get away!

577
01:35:41,133 --> 01:35:43,465
<i>(gunshot)</i>

578
01:36:41,927 --> 01:36:44,259
<i>(music on radio)</i>

579
01:36:58,878 --> 01:36:60,675
<i>Mike,</i>

580
01:36:61,614 --> 01:37:04,811
What are you doing here?

581
01:37:04,884 --> 01:37:08,479
<i>I'm on my way north,
The snow is coming,</i>

582
01:37:10,756 --> 01:37:13,247
Have you seen Ootek?

583
01:37:13,325 --> 01:37:14,883
<i>No,</i>

584
01:37:15,995 --> 01:37:18,793
<i>He just disappeared,
We were out there and he,,,</i>

585
01:37:18,864 --> 01:37:25,497
<i>Yeah, I know, The old ones seem to have
a way of doing that, just disappearing,</i>

586
01:37:26,238 --> 01:37:29,207
<i>Which is what I'm about to do,</i>

587
01:37:42,888 --> 01:37:47,825
Have you seen the wolves?
Have you seen George and Angie?

588
01:37:47,893 --> 01:37:50,487
<i>No, they must have gone north,</i>

589
01:37:50,562 --> 01:37:54,658
<i>No, No, the puppies are still here, They
wouldn't go off and leave the puppies,</i>

590
01:37:54,733 --> 01:37:59,466
<i>Stop worrying about the pups
and start worrying about yourself,</i>

591
01:37:59,538 --> 01:38:03,304
<i>This thing that's happening
is too big for you,</i>

592
01:38:06,345 --> 01:38:09,906
<i>It's a question of how you survive it,</i>

593
01:38:13,519 --> 01:38:15,646
<i>Survival,,,</i>

594
01:38:17,256 --> 01:38:19,781
<i>of the fittest,</i>

595
01:39:14,413 --> 01:39:16,404
<i>(# bassoon playing)</i>

596
01:39:27,726 --> 01:39:30,752
<i>In the end, there were no simple answers.</i>

597
01:39:30,829 --> 01:39:32,820
<i>No heroes, no villains.</i>

598
01:39:34,433 --> 01:39:36,298
<i>Only silence.</i>

599
01:39:48,414 --> 01:39:53,477
<i>But it began the moment
that I first saw the wolf.</i>

600
01:39:53,552 --> 01:39:58,615
<i>By the act of watching them,
with the eyes of a man,</i>

601
01:39:58,690 --> 01:40:02,319
<i>I had pointed the way
for those who followed.</i>

602
01:40:05,764 --> 01:40:07,755
<i>(howling)</i>

603
01:40:54,546 --> 01:40:59,540
<i>The pack returned for the cubs, as
there are no orphans among the wolves.</i>

604
01:40:59,618 --> 01:41:04,055
<i>And eventually the losses of that autumn
became a distant memory.</i>

605
01:41:17,903 --> 01:41:22,533
<i>I believe the wolves went off to a wild
and distant place somewhere,</i>

606
01:41:22,608 --> 01:41:25,304
<i>although I don 't really know,</i>

607
01:41:25,377 --> 01:41:29,871
<i>because I turned away
and didn 't watch them go.</i>
